- 👋 Hello, I’m @nonolabs. Creating this repository is way long overdue as I have multiple production scripts and whatnots that should be shared with the world. I have wanted to create a blog for the longest time but time has always been an enemy of mine. As I find myself battling certain health issues I realize that the information that I have gained will be better served if others had access to it. I could start with my own format on this read me but I believe it will be faster and more information will be properly shared if I just follow the format given.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in scripts, and programs that help my fellow IT person out in the field to get their job done. Some scripts take hours/days to perfect and test properly and anything I can contribute will help. 
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on combining all Windows Debloaters, Cleaners, and an installation script to setup clients, maximize the performce of existing production machines, and repair tools at the fingertips as I rely on my USB drive as I am sure most people do.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I will leave this open so as not to limit the horizon I could reach.
- 
- 📫 Send me a message through here. I have a website that will be coming soon.
